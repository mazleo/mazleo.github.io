            <p>SongLib is my first JavaFX program. Doing this school project, I learned how much I love designing a GUI application. Styling was unnecessary as that part of the project wasn't going to be graded, though I really enjoyed this project so I did it anyway. Programming the controllers for the application was the most interesting part. I loved making the little buttons I made do what I wanted them to do. It's a very small application, but I feel like I grew as a programmer with this project.</p>
