        <h2>RETRO NIGHT</h2>

        <div class='description'>
            <p>Retro night is my first THREE.js project, though a lot of it is based on a terrain CodePen I found. This animation is inspired by an image I found on Google while trying to find new wallpapers for my laptop. Here is the image I found:</p>
            <p><img alt='Retro Night Inspiration' src='images/Retro night inspiration.jpg' /></p>
            <p>This is my first time diving into 3D javascript libraries, and though I feel I somewhat succeeded in creating what I envisioned, I feel I still need more practice in web animations in general, whether it'd be 2D or 3D. I definitely need to read some documentation and tutorials on it, so I definitely plan on working on that in the future!</p>
            <p>Another thing I would like to work on in the future is another version of this animation. Instead of rendering mountains, it would be cool to render a retro-themed water animation bellow the retro sun. Definitely a more advanced animation and I probably do not have enough experience to make it at the moment but I look forward to working on that!</p>
